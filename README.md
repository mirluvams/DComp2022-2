# Introduction
The following project documents the practical application of several distributed computing systems to obtain an accurate respresentation of international flights around the globe, through the analysis of results from the [_OpenSky Network_]https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/python.html) (OpenSky Network | OpenSky) by making use of their realtime data reports through the (link of API) to obtain the raw data required for the analysis, through the processses of four main servers: collecting and pulling data from OpenSky, storing and analyzing a database using SQL, creating a realtime map based on specific requirements, displaying the map using a web service, all the while making use of modern data science libraries.

#Justification

The need for such a project stems from a simple way to see real-time flights around the globe given that 


# General Objective
The expected output of this project is a representation of real-time flights around the globe shown on a map. Said representations are to be obtained through the use of concise mapping APIs, showcasing the airplains moving according to their specific information, for example, origin and destiny.

# Toolset
The project is expected to be developed making use of several python 3.10+ libraries, such as the following:

* NumPy: [https://numpy.org/] 
* Pandas: [https://pandas.pydata.org/]
* OpenSky: [http://opensky.org/]
* SQL: [https://sql.org/]
